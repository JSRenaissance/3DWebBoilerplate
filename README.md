# 3DWebBoilerplate

Your quick set up for developing the 3DWeb. This lightweight dev environment structure and process allows for better web animations as fast as possible. 

It utilizes npm http-server, BabylonJS, ThreeJS, TweenJS, AFrame, fontawesome. And in the not-so-distant past; jQuery, d3, and greensock. The web has come a long way!

Now it is primed to utilize and innovate AR.js demos.


## Get set up animating the 3DWeb as fast as possible.


- BabylonJS Development Environment - it is very possible to develop Babylon with bigger IDE's, do you really want to? Are you sure?

- 3DWeb is fastest with everything as light as possible.  Maximum flexibility is a primary benefit for reaching maximum 3DWeb speed.

- This module is a template environment and a process, two benefits toward better animations.


## First install npm and then npm install -g http-server

 - This will give you a very light-weight server which can be run over any directory.

 - All downstream .htmls can be instantly pulled into view. yet another benefit.

 - I keep hundreds of downstream .htmls ready for instant access at any moments notice.

 - That allows fast animation from a library-like lookup structure.


 ## Run-Server 

 - In command line, in the root directory, anywhere above your index.html, run: http-server

 - I like three levels up. This will start up a server listening on http://localhost:8080

 - where you can access all of your animations under a URL like this:  http://localhost:8080/3DWebBoilerplate/demos/template1/

 

 ## Demos

 - The /demos folder is ideal you can iterate into the hundreds of examples in a lookup-like way.

 - Create a new sub-folder under demos and increment the number every time you wish to create a new version of an animation.

 - It gives you a safety-net to try audacious things like tight-rope-walking. Just do it. 
 
 - If you like a previous prototype, it is easy to roll that forward to the next version. 


 # Animation-Process

 ## Templates123...

 - First look for /demos/template1, /template2, template3/...

 - These are different versions of templates. Helpful? Yes.

 - When you start a new animation - the notion is to use the template which best matches the task!

 - I keep a half dozen different templates for differentthings.
 
  - Duplicate it to a /project and pop it up in the brower instantly.

 - See? Now you are ready to rock! This is _the way of the work_. : )


 ## Environment

 - There are important folders at root level within the demos /3d, /img, /lib, and /license.

 - 1. Whenever you add an asset to the environment -> add the license to the /licenses folder 
 
      -> important. So you make animations that don't forget licenses.
 
 - 2. Add assets to either /3d, /img, or /lib. Just like css, js, img, remember? Same but different.

 - 3. /lib is the best folder because it contains all of the various libraries that create the animation.

 - Right now the /lib folder relies primarily on BabylonJS, ThreeJS, ARJS.

 - But in the past it was jQuery, d3, and Greensock - we've come a long way baby!

 - And yes, it will change somewhere in the world by the next git push.
 
 - which is why I keep static copies. Turns out some thing break sometimes. (looking at you v.3).


 ## Projects

 - Another nice thing about this structure is that it also exports to projects as fast as possible too!

 - Simply duplicate the /demo structure with clean sub-folders. Such as /blankProject. Now you are ready to start new projects. Ta-da!

 - Process: run /demos when you are testing capabilities, then duplicate /blankProject123 for the things that you deliver to production.

 
 ## Scenes

 - Check this out. After you duplicate blankProject123 to bigWigClient123, look inside!

 - Beneath all of your template boilerplate is a folder called /scene123
 
 - It contains the (atomic) index.html and scene.js files.
 
 - In this way of work, the index.html can access the scene directly. 
 
 - But also, the scene.js can be composed up into higher structures, like a movie. : )

 - Duplicate that folder (which can contain scene boilerplates) to rapidly create scenes. Ding!

 - Reuse those scenes for all of the new scenes that you make, and you'll be stretching toward nirvana.

 - That is why... I do it this way, and I recommend giving it a try (at least).



 *I hope this helps you.* : )
